                                  <strong>There is a lot I can say about this. We put a lot of thought into where our rents are at because we feel that it really affects how the investment performs. While some people that sell investment properties push their rents to the max the market will bear, allowing them to advertise flashy cash flows, this typically causes the property to turn over at the lease end, and this vacancy reduces the return on investment for the investor over what the inflated rent brought them. Not only do we not push our rents to the max the market will bear, we believe our business model is so successful because we rent our properties at slightly below market rates. A little bit about our philosophy:</strong>
                                  <br/>
                                  <br/>

                                  Keeping rents at slightly below market rates increases the likelihood of a long term tenant. Vacancy is the biggest killer of return on investment for rental property. Our typical property rents for $995 per month, not the $1,000 - $1025 per month that many other similar properties in the same area rent for. Although $25-$50 per month is not a lot of money for us investors, it *is* a lot of money for our tenants. This small difference, combined with the high-quality of our homes, encourages lease renewals and keeps your property occupied and cash-flowing.
                                  <br/>
                                  <br/>
                                  To further answer your question, we do price the properties based on varying factors, just often more than simply bedrooms and bathrooms. In some areas, rents are a little higher (but so are their taxes, so cash flow is mostly the same) so a 2 bedroom in one area may rent for $995 while a three bedroom in a different, more affordable area may also rent for $995. Also, sometimes we have a two bedroom that is on a slightly larger lot, or has a garage, or there is a three bedroom but the overall square footage of the house is not as big as some, etc.

                                    Total monthly payment is going to be a reflection of the information you've entered into the 'Customize My Cashflows' box at the top of available properties. It is the figure subtracted from your monthly rent to come up with your estimated cash flows. For cash purchases, the figure includes monthly taxes and insurance costs. For financed purchases, The Total Monthly Payment reflects your estimated debt service (monthly mortgage payment, principal and interest), and your monthly taxes and insurance costs as well.

                                  You do not have to buy title insurance, however it's relatively inexpensive and we purchase it ourselves on all of our properties. When you buy a property from us, it will absolutely be free of all debts and liens. Our closing attorney, is extremely experienced with overseas closings and can provide you with top-notch legal council, title insurance, proof that the property is unencumbered with any liens or debts, etc. Regarding a warranty, all our properties are completely renovated from top to bottom with no deferred maintenance. However, all our properties come with several comprehensive warranties, please see the warranty of our section of our website for more details.

                                  In Australia, the laws seem to protect the tenant rather than the home owner. Tennessee and Arkansas are considered "landlord friendly" states; we can evict 30 days from the first missed payment. We typically develop very good relationships with our tenants to try to avoid this and work with the tenant to minimize any expense for our investor-buyers.

                                  For our financed investors, on the day you join the waitlist, we'll set an appointment on our calendar for some months out, to set you up with a great lender close to the time we expect you to see available inventory. We work with a specific subset of investment specific lenders to support high cash flows for our purchasing investors; only working with those who specialize in investment deals, and can get you a fantastic interest rate, low closing costs, and best of all, the ability to get you closed smoothly and quickly. Our typical investor puts 20% down on a 30 year note. Once you're pre-approved, you'll only need to make a move when you see the exact price point, ROI, or cashflow you had in mind.

                                  For the approximately 20% of our investors who prefer to pay full cash, the process is even simpler, and the waitimes typically shorter because of extra inventory that is available solely to cash only investors.

                                  Selecting a property once you've reached the top of the list is just as easy and painless. We will email you our newest inventory as we get it in and you will match yourself with your perfect property when you see it. There's no 'assigning' or 'picking from a list', you'll just see a steady flow of properties, and because our inventory is so interchangeable, folks are usually moving forward to close with their ideal house in just a few weeks.

                                  You can preview the exact type of houses we will be sending you by looking at our current available property section of the website. They're almost interchangeable due to the nature of our business model. You'll notice as you click through the website that we buy in the same neighborhoods over and over again, because they've proven to be safe and profitable, and we do the same renovation again and again, and rent at the same rates, so minor differences in cash flow due to different property taxes is one of the few differentiators.

                                    Taxes are annual city and county taxes, and the homeowner pays them. They are pro-rated from the day of closing, meaning we will pay the portion of the taxes covering the time we owned the home and the investor becomes responsible for them from the day they close. Investors with loans pay their taxes in monthly installments through their mortgage companies, so these taxes become part of their monthly payment to the bank (thus PITI). For you, even though you will probably pay them for the year when they're due, you can still average them out to a monthly cost to understand what your true cash flow on the property is.

                                    Terry says that he never makes an offer to purchase and renovate a property unless it's a property that he's willing to keep long term. We typically review 25 homes before we make an offer on one. In our markets, there is a sweet spot for profitable investing in stable, blue-collar neighborhoods. We focus our investing efforts in that area because if you go down too low you will have tenants that will be problematic and war zone type neighborhoods. If you go up too high, the taxes go up, the insurance goes up, the debt service goes up, but the rent does not go up enough to keep pace. Especially in Frayser, which is one of our favorite places to invest, the cash flow is tremendous. Their size and construction lends to great return on investment.

                                    How do you deal with nonpayments and evicting tenants if need be? The owner is always the boss on this one, but we have developed strategies to minimize any lost income. We develop fantastic relationships with our tenants and they go out of their way to pay us or work on a payment plan. The way we proceed really depends on the tenant and their circumstances (we treat a tenant that has paid on time for a year that suddenly lost their job differently than someone that, for example, has been a chronic late pay and is uncommunicative).
