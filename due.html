                When researching turnkey sellers, you'll find that many of them don't actually own the properties
                they're selling. They are simply marketing properties for others, acting as middlemen between you and
                the true owners. There's not anything necessarily wrong with this concept, but it's your job to try and
                find the direct source. Doing so cuts out all the fat and gives you the best possible return on your
                investment.

                <br />
                <br />

                Finding the true owner can be tricky however, because middlemen are pros at disguising themselves as the
                actual owners of the properties they're selling. Not only that, they'll often insinuate they're
                principles of the management company that will be managing your property. Be careful you're not being
                referred to a management company that is one of their affiliates. If a seller refers to a person or
                company as one of their affiliates or partners in regards to the purchase, sale, renovation or
                management of a property, then you must know that the middleman has limited or no control over that
                aspect of your investment.

                understanding of how to make this business work. Do your homework. Ask sellers the tough questions, and
                then do your own research to verify their answers. This is your hard earned money we're talking about.
                Protect it. Many investors bought properties before 2007 when rental properties could be bought and
                financed at 100% loan to value. Most of those investors are now bankrupt. Their down fall was over
                leveraging. They didn't simply buy their properties and put loans on them for the amount of their
                investment. They made a poor business decision and participated in what has rightly become the dirty
                word in banking nowadays. They did "cash-out refinances". A cash-out refinance is a type of loan in
                which the owner refinances a property they'd previously purchased. Upon closing on the refinance, they
                pulled "cash out" ultimately removing the equity from the property. This was bad for several reasons:
                <br />
                <br />
                Because they pulled cash out on the refinance, they incurred more debt to service, which decreased their
                cash-flow.
                <br />
                <br />
                All of the closing costs associated with the second closing were rolled into the amount of the new loan.
                This added even more debt to service, further diminishing cash-flow.
                The owner now has an over-leveraged property that according to federal guidelines must now pay mortgage
                insurance as part of the monthly payment. This again further decreases cash-flow.
                Cash out refinance loans received higher interest rates because they were riskier. Higher interest rates
                = higher monthly payments = less cash flow.
                <br />
                <br />
                Investors kidded themselves into thinking the borrowed funds from the cash outs were profit and would
                float the negative cash-flow from their rentals. Because cash out financing was easy to access, a lot of
                investors jumped on the bandwagon. They increased their lifestyles by doing as many of these as they
                could, and lived off the borrowed funds. When the music stopped and the cash out refinancing option was
                no longer available, a lot of investors found out the hard way that their business models were very
                flawed. Their properties didn't cash flow in the long term because they couldn't withstand the
                occasional vacancy and repair associated with investment property. The only way their business model
                could sustain itself was through continued cash outs with new acquisitions. Needless to say, investors
                with this business model ultimately met with financial disaster. Most of these investors were never
                particularly good at renovating or managing property. They simply bought them, removed the equity with a
                cash-out refi, and handed their properties off to a third party management company. Today, you'll find a
                lot of these same individuals posing as successful turn key real estate investors. Most of them still
                don't renovate or manage property. Their forte is now just good marketing. Because they're no longer
                able to secure financing, they market other people's properties as their own, increasing the purchase
                price while rarely providing any additional value.

                <strong>BUYING DISTRESSED TURNKEY PROPERTY</strong>
                There are some turnkey sellers that specialize in selling distressed property promising renovation and
                management after your purchase. Although there are good deals out there that fit this description, they
                call for a lot more due diligence than purchasing property that has no deferred maintenance and is
                already cash flowing.

                <br />
                If you purchase a distressed property from a seller that promises a good renovation after you purchase,
                please get very serious on your due diligence. Unless you are a very seasoned pro, I suggest you spend a
                few hundred bucks and hire an inspector to give you a detailed report on the condition of the property
                and an estimate of the cost of renovation. This is how I bought my very first house. Armed with the
                inspection report and an estimate of the cost to rehab the property, I revisited the seller with a much
                lower offer. I saved about $10,000 and a lot of heartache.

                <strong>I'll admit that this is a loaded question because there's hardly any comparison between the two
                  options. Without a doubt one of the biggest ways new or out of town investors get in trouble is by
                  purchasing distressed, vacant property based on the seller's opinions of the following:</strong>
                <br />
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The supposed condition of the property

                  <li>
                    The hypothetical cost of renovation

                </ul>
                Even if you're dealing with an ethical seller, any of the above factors can easily incur overruns or not
                go as expected, costing you money and lowering your anticipated return on investment. If everything were
                to go exactly as projected, you're still looking at several months without cash flow and the risks
                associated with vacant property. See question 15 for more info on the dangers of vacant property. In
                addition, if you're borrowing money from a financial institution, you'll have two closings, consequently
                doubling your closing costs. In short, if you're going to buy distressed property outside of your own
                market,
                please be extremely careful and certainly don't compare it with a true turn key investment.

                Look for a turn key seller that offers a one year home warranty. If you're buying a property, especially
                if you're from out of town, this should not be negotiable. If your seller is not confident enough in
                their product to offer a home warranty, you should at the very least insist on a detailed home
                inspection from a third party inspector. Home inspections typically cost
                $350-$500 and are a must-have if your property does not come with a one year warranty.

                <strong>return is the cost of your initial investment combined with the cost of vacancies over the long
                  term.</strong>
                I advise each and every investor I counsel to treat their investment property like a business.
                One aspect of this is understanding that at some point in the future, your property will experience
                turnover.
                In this graph we compare a typical $120,000 investment property with a typical $200,000 investment
                property.
                You may be surprised by how two properties with identical gross cash-flows have such a large variance in
                returns.
                <strong>difference in square footage and initial down payment drastically affect the return.</strong>

                The main thing you are trying to discern is whether or not the properties are in what investors call the
                "war zone". Different investors have different goals in regards to investment property. Some investors
                are more interested in long term appreciation, while others are looking for the highest cash flow
                possible. No matter what market you're interested in, all major cities will have neighborhoods you don't
                want to invest in, regardless of the price of the property. I've passed on property that was literally
                offered to me for free.

                If one end of the property spectrum is the war zone, the other end is the million dollar neighborhoods.

                The answer needs to be yes. If it's not, keep looking. Besides the purchase price of your property, the
                quality of management is the number one factor for how well your investment performs.

                The best performing properties experience positive returns because of the quality of the property,
                timely maintenance service, and accessibility to management. When dealing with separate sellers and
                managers, there is often finger pointing from seller to manager and back again in regards to faulty
                performance. Do yourself a favor and leave the accountability in one spot under the same roof.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another small but distinct advantage of buying from a seller who owns the management company that will
                manage your investment, is that the maintenance will most likely be performed by the same crews that
                performed the renovation. If this is the case, their familiarity with the property will eventually save
                you money on repairs down the road.

                The best answer you can receive is that the property is rented at slightly below market rates. Keeping
                rents slightly below market increases the likelihood of a long term tenant. Vacancy, not slightly
                reduced rent, is the biggest killer of return on investment for rental property.
                <br />
                <br />
                For example, if market rent for a property is $725/month, it is wise to market and rent that property
                for $675-$700 per month. Although $25-$50 per month is not a lot of money to us investors, it is a lot
                of money to the tenant. This small difference, when combined with a rental that is in top condition,
                encourages lease renewals and will keep your property occupied and cash flowing for years to come.
                Utilizing this strategy will increase the return on your investment well above the additional $25-$50
                per month you would have received in rent.

                <strong>When shopping for turn-key real estate, don't compare vacant properties with occupied,
                  cash-flowing investments. They're not apples to apples investments and should be valued accordingly.

                <strong>If you're considering purchasing a vacant property you should be aware of the many potential
                  problems associated with this type of purchase. Some of the problems that accompany the purchase of
                  vacant property are:</strong>
                A) It's impossible to know how long the property will sit vacant before becoming occupied. Vacancies are
                the biggest killer of return on investment in real estate. It's a bummer to start your investment off
                with several months of vacancy, putting your ROI in the hole right from the start.
                <br />
                <br />
                B) One of the biggest "gotchas" of purchasing vacant rental property is finding out market rental rates
                are significantly less than you were led to believe. Your decision to purchase was based on a cash flow
                that was unattainable. Regardless of whether or not the property you're about to purchase is vacant, you
                should check market rents to make sure the proposed rent of the subject property is on par for the area
                (or preferably slightly below. See question #14).

                <strong>
                  It's absolutely possible to rent a property at above market rates but the potential for lease renewal
                  will be slight, drastically increasing your likelihood of vacancy and simultaneously reducing your
                  return on investment.
                </strong>
                Typically, the only reason a tenant will pay above market rent is because they are not able to rent
                elsewhere. Most tenants paying above market rent have worse than average credit, often times with
                multiple evictions. These are not the types of tenants you want in your home.
                <br />
                <br />
                C) The potential for vandalism and theft increases exponentially when the property is vacant, regardless
                of the quality of the neighborhood.
                <br />
                <br />
                D) Most Landlord insurance policies have a 30 day vacancy clause. Unless you have a specific vacant
                property insurance policy, your property will be exposed to liability for fire, theft, vandalism, acts
                of God, etc.

                If you're going to buy a vacant property, don't close unless you have a vacant insurance policy. Get
                ready for sticker shock. Vacant insurance policies cost up to four times as much as a regular landlord
                policy.

                A true turn key investment will provide cash flow within a very short time of closing and be free of the
                potential pitfalls associated with vacant property.

                If a property has been vacant longer than 45 days, there is a potential problem. You're trying to find
                out what the problem is. Is it a two bedroom and the market is for three bedrooms? Is it in an
                undesirable part of town? Find out what the problem is and make sure to avoid purchasing similar
                properties. Sometimes a property that has a special price also has a special problem.

                You can't allow this question to be a deal breaker when you're shopping because unfortunately, the
                overwhelming majority of turn key outfits are going to answer "Yes". This is because application fees
                are a huge profit center for management companies. However, if you're lucky enough to stumble across a
                management company that absorbs the cost of applications, you've found a good one.
                <br />
                <br />
                A management company that absorbs the costs of screening applicants ensures that the maximum number of
                individuals will apply to rent your property. Having a larger pool of applicants to choose from allows
                them to select the absolute best tenant for your property. This type of management team is focused on
                finding the best quality tenant, (the lifeblood of all real estate investments) not making money on
                application fees. This is the hallmark of an owner-focused management style.

                This is a sticky liability issue, and we are in no way real estate attorneys. However, in the opinion of
                the author, proper due diligence would include asking to see the lease the management company uses. If
                specific breeds aren't permitted, it will be stated in the lease. Do a little research and you'll find
                that other investors have had legal trouble over this issue.

                This is an especially important question for out of town investors and you should expect nothing less.
                HD recording options are now readily available, and any property management company worth its salt
                should offer this service to its investors.

                <br />
                If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a million. There's nothing like a detailed
                video explanation to give you confidence and understanding of the work to be performed on your property.
                As the saying goes, locks keep honest people honest and video doesn't lie. Insist on it.
