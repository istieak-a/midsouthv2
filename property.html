                        Below Market Rents: Keeping rents at slightly below market rates increases the likelihood of a
                        long term tenant. Vacancy is the biggest killer of return on investment for rental property. Our
                        typical property rents for $675 per month, not the $700 – $725 per month that many other similar
                        properties in the same area rent for. Although $25-$50 per month is not a lot of money for us
                        investors, it is a lot of money for our tenants. This small difference, combined with the
                        high-quality of our homes, encourages lease renewals and keeps your property occupied and
                        cash-flowing.

                        Almost all property management companies will charge a $25–$50 application fee to the applicant
                        for the above services. Although this is one of the largest profit centers for a typical
                        property management company, this drastically reduces the number of applicants that apply. Mid
                        South Best Rentals understands that by absorbing this cost ourselves, we get many more
                        applicants through the front door. Having the ability to look at ten applicants instead three
                        offers us the best opportunity to select the most qualified applicant for your investment home.

                        In-house contractors: We have a dedicated full-time staff of maintenance professionals with the

                        properties are completely renovated from top to bottom with no
                        deferred maintenance, at some point in the future your property will require repairs. When that
                        day arrives, you can count on us to keep the cost of repairs at a minimum by dispatching a
                        member of our in-house maintenance team, not contracting with expensive outside repair
                        companies. In short, the seamless relationship between Mid South Best Rentals and Mid South Home

                        Compassionate but firm collections: Our approach in
                        collections is not only compassionate but positively affects our bottom line.
                        When a tenant falls behind, it’s important to keep the big picture in mind: return on
                        investment.
                        If a tenant is not paying, then the property is not performing. However, starting eviction
                        proceedings as soon as soon as a
                        tenant falls behind is shortsighted. This is where the relationship
                        between property manager and tenant is key, and this is where Mid South Best Rentals value is
                        unquestionably
                        second to none. Compassionate collections are as much an art as a science. By providing
                        excellent housing,
                        slightly below market rents, timely repairs, and by treating our tenants like the wonderful
                        people they are,
                        we’ve built a foundation of trust and loyalty that has endeared our tenants to us.
                        The unique relationship between Mid South Best Rentals and our tenants is one of the key reasons
                        Mid South Home Buyers investment
                        properties are the best performing real estate investments in the turn key industry.
