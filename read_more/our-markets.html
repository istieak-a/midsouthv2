                    Memphis, TN offers a unique opportunity for cash flowing investment properties. Some of the highest
                    cash flows available in the U.S. are available here, due to a combination of our high percentage of
                    renters (almost 50% of the Memphis population rents) and our incredibly low purchase prices. This
                    purchase price to rent ratio is what makes Memphis, TN the number one best choice for real estate
                    investors around the globe. Below are a few statistics about Memphis, the birthplace of rock and

                    Little Rock is where <a class="makeclor" href="https://www.fisglobal.com/en/about-us">FIS </a>was
                    founded in 1968. If you don't know the name, they are the largest fin-tech company in the world now
                    with annual revenue exceeding $9 billion. Though they are now a division of Fidelity National
                    Financial, their largest presence is still in Little Rock.

                    The FIS Accelerator is less about disruption and more about mass distribution. Because FIS works
                    with all of the large banking and financial institutions in the world, it is a one-stop shop for
                    entrepreneurs to get their product/service seen by all of their largest potential clients. That's
                    incredibly valuable for an entrepreneur. A lot of accelerators provide capital and advice, few can
                    guarantee large client intros.

                <p class="take-group-info">
                    This, coupled with a longer window to test because of low-cost living, has attracted top global

                    Over time, as Little Rock attracts more fin-tech entrepreneurs, other industries will grow as
                    natural offshoots. But if you're looking to create something in fin-tech, Little Rock ranks right up
                    there with Charlotte, San Francisco and New York as a top destination.

                    Mid South Home Buyers has been renowned for their expert knowledge in renovations, property
                    management, and excellent customer service to investors within the turn key space in Memphis, TN for
                    over 17 years now.

                    Despite repeated requests from their existing investors to expand to other markets, MSHB patiently
                    waited to expand until they could be assured of 2 things: 1) that they could expand to another
                    market without any focus or attention taken away from the pristine quality of their turn key
                    properties in Memphis and 2) that they could find a market where they could deliver an identically
                    strong investment product utilizing the vertical integration and attention to detail that has given
                    the company a cult-like following within the turn key investment community.

                    Little Rock fit the bill in every way imaginable. Only a short 2 hour drive from Memphis, Little

                    Mid South will ever offer to investors, not once but twice (at the initial debut to plan the
                    renovation and personally set the rent, and again at the conclusion of the total renovation to
                    assure that everything is perfect).

                <p class="ake-group-info">
                    The close proximity also allows us to utilize our 30,000 square foot warehouse in Memphis, so that

                    Rock, which is the key to our unique ability to offer totally renovated properties with all new

                    the renter, while providing an owner-focused style of property management without up-charging
                    materials or maintenance services and continuing to offer lower tenant placement costs, and high
                    occupancy and resident retention rates.
