                “In 2013, my friends and family thought I was crazy to invest in Memphis TN. I did not have acquaintances or family in the State. I took a chance after listening to the Real Estate Guys interview with Terry Kerr. I got tired of standing on the sidelines and wanted to shoot my shot in real estate investing. I later gave Terry a call in April 2013 to set up an appointment that would change the course of my life forever. Because I booked the trip, this has trickled down to three people within my circle who are closing in the next couple of months. To invest remotely requires trust and MidSouth has earned mines. Thank you all, and be safe during these turbulent times.
